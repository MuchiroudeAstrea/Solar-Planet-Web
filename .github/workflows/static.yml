    ref: # optional
    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.

We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary. Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.

    ssh-key: # optional
    # Known hosts in addition to the user and global host key database. The public SSH keys for a host may be obtained using the utility `ssh-keyscan`. For example, `ssh-keyscan github.com`. The public key for github.com is always implicitly added.

    ssh-known-hosts: # optional
    # Whether to perform strict host key checking. When true, adds the options `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` and `CheckHostIP=no` to the SSH command line. Use the input `ssh-known-hosts` to configure additional hosts.

    ssh-strict: # optional, default is true
    # The user to use when connecting to the remote SSH host. By default 'git' is used.

    ssh-user: # optional, default is git
    # Whether to configure the token or SSH key with the local git config
    persist-credentials: # optional, default is true
    # Relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE to place the repository
    path: # optional
    # Whether to execute `git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD` before fetching
    clean: # optional, default is true
    # Partially clone against a given filter. Overrides sparse-checkout if set.

    filter: # optional
    # Do a sparse checkout on given patterns. Each pattern should be separated with new lines.

    sparse-checkout: # optional
    # Specifies whether to use cone-mode when doing a sparse checkout.

    sparse-checkout-cone-mode: # optional, default is true
    # Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history for all branches and tags.
    fetch-depth: # optional, default is 1
    # Whether to fetch tags, even if fetch-depth > 0.
    fetch-tags: # optional
    # Whether to show progress status output when fetching.
    show-progress: # optional, default is true
    # Whether to download Git-LFS files
    lfs: # optional
    # Whether to checkout submodules: `true` to checkout submodules or `recursive` to recursively checkout submodules.

When the `ssh-key` input is not provided, SSH URLs beginning with `git@github.com:` are converted to HTTPS.

    submodules: # optional
    # Add repository path as safe.directory for Git global config by running `git config --global --add safe.directory <path>`
    set-safe-directory: # optional, default is true
    # The base URL for the GitHub instance that you are trying to clone from, will use environment defaults to fetch from the same instance that the workflow is running from unless specified. Example URLs are https://github.com or https://my-ghes-server.example.com
